## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Setup Task

As part of setting up the App Service, you create:

* A new resource group to contain all of the Azure resources for the service.
* A new Hosting Plan that specifies the location, size, and features of the web server farm that hosts your app.

Follow these steps to create your App Service resources and publish your project:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **Command Palette** by selecting **View > Command Palette**.
1. Search for and select **Azure App Service: Create New Web App (Advanced)**.

3. Respond to the prompts as follows:

    1. If prompted, sign in to your Azure account.
    1. Select your **Subscription**.
    1. Select **Create new Web App... Advanced**.
    1. For **Enter a globally unique name**, use a name that's unique across all of Azure (valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`). A good pattern is to use a combination of your company name and an app identifier.
    1. Select Create new resource group and provide a name like `myResourceGroup`.
    1. When prompted to **Select a runtime stack**, select **.NET 7 (STS)**.
    1. **Select an operating system** (Windows or Linux).
    1. Select a location near you.
    1. Select **Create a new App Service plan**, provide a name, and select the **F1 Free** pricing tier.
    1. Select S**kip for now** for the **Application Insights** resource.
    1. When prompted, select **Deploy**.
    1. Select MyFirstAzureWebApp as the folder to deploy.
    1. Select Add Config when prompted.

1. In the popup **Always deploy the workspace "MyFirstAzureWebApp" to \<app-name\>**, select **Yes** so that Visual Studio Code deploys to the same App Service app every time you're in that workspace.

1. When publishing completes, select **Browse Website** in the notification and select Open when prompted.

You see the ASP.NET Core 7.0 web app displayed in the page.
